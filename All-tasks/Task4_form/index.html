                <blockquote>
                The term "Palestine" (in Latin, Palæstina) is thought to have been a term coined by the Ancient Greeks for the area of land occupied by the Philistines, although there are other explanations.[29] Palestine is a country[19] that, although not present on any current political map, remains deeply alive in the hearts of its people, who often refer to it as a country in exile.The term Palestine is also used to refer to geographical region region in the West Asia, comprising of modern-day <abbr title="الاحتلال">Israel</abbr>, the West Bank, and Gaza. [30] General use of the term "Palestine" or related terms to the area at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea beside Syria has historically been taking place since the times of ancient Greece, with Herodotus being the first historian writing in the 5th century BC in The Histories of a "district of Syria, called Palaistine" in which Phoenicians interacted with other maritime peoples 
                <h3>Terminology</h3>
                This article uses the terms "Palestine", "State of Palestine", "occupied Palestinian territory (oPt or <abbr title="occupied Palestinian territory">OPT</abbr>)" interchangeably depending on context. Specifically, the term "occupied Palestinian territory" refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Palestine can be referred to as a State or Country, and its authorities can generally be identified as the Government of Palestine.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as nationalist sentiments grew across the region, Palestinian Arab nationalism also began to emerge.[34] Intellectuals and elites in Palestine expressed a sense of identity and called for greater autonomy and self-governance.[35] This period coincided with the rise of the Young Turks movement within the Ottoman Empire, which introduced some political reforms but also faced opposition from various groups.[36] In the early 20th century, the Zionist movement gained momentum, aiming to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.[37][38] Jewish immigration increased, and Zionist organizations purchased land from local landowners, leading to tensions between Jews and Arabs.[39] Abdul Hamid, the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, opposed the Zionist movement's efforts in Palestine. The end of the Ottoman Empire's rule in Palestine came with the conclusion of World War I. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the region came under British control with the implementation of the British Mandate for Palestine in 1920.
                    <h3>British Mandate</h3> 
                    The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I resulted in the dismantling of their rule.[42] In 1920, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate to govern Palestine, leading to the subsequent period of British administration.[42] In 1917, Jerusalem was captured by British forces led by General Allenby, marking the end of Ottoman rule in the city.[42]

                    By 1920, tensions escalated between Jewish and Arab communities, resulting in violent clashes and riots across Palestine.[42] The League of Nations approved the British Mandate for Palestine in 1922, entrusting Britain with the administration of the region.[42] Throughout the 1920s, Palestine experienced growing resistance from both Jewish and Arab nationalist movements, which manifested in sporadic violence and protests against British policies.[42] In 1929, violent riots erupted in Palestine due to disputes over Jewish immigration and access to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.[42] The 1930s witnessed the outbreak of the Arab Revolt, as Arab nationalists demanded an end to Jewish immigration and the establishment of an independent Arab state.[42] In response to the Arab Revolt, the British deployed military forces and implemented stringent security measures in an effort to quell the uprising.[42]
                    <br>
                    Arab nationalist groups, led by the Arab Higher Committee, called for an end to Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews.[43] The issuance of the 1939 White Paper by the British government aimed to address escalating tensions between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.[43] This policy document imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration and land purchases, with the intention to limit the establishment of a Jewish state.[43] Met with strong opposition from the Zionist movement, the White Paper was perceived as a betrayal of the Balfour Declaration and Zionist aspirations for a Jewish homeland.[43] In response to the White Paper, the Zionist community in Palestine organized a strike in 1939, rallying against the restrictions on Jewish immigration and land acquisition.[43] This anti-White Paper strike involved demonstrations, civil disobedience, and a shutdown of businesses.[43] Supported by various Zionist organizations, including the Jewish Agency and the Histadrut (General Federation of Jewish Labor), the anti-White Paper strike aimed to protest and challenge the limitations imposed by the British government.[43]
                    <br>
                    In the late 1930s and 1940s, several Zionist militant groups, including the Irgun, Hagana, and Lehi, carried out acts of violence against British military and civilian targets in their pursuit of an independent Jewish state.[43] While the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, inot all Muslims supported his actions, and there were instances where Muslims helped rescue Jews during the Holocaust.[43] In 1946, a bombing orchestrated by the Irgun at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of 91 people, including British officials, civilians, and hotel staff.[43] Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, who later became political leaders in the state of Israel, were behind these terrorist attacks.[44] The Exodus 1947 incident unfolded when a ship carrying Jewish Holocaust survivors, who sought refuge in Palestine, was intercepted by the British navy, leading to clashes and the eventual deportation of the refugees back to Europe.[43] During World War II, Palestine served as a strategically significant location for British military operations against Axis forces in North Africa.[43] In 1947, the United Nations proposed a partition plan for Palestine, suggesting separate Jewish and Arab states, but it was rejected by Arab nations while accepted by Jewish leaders.
                    <h3>Arab Israeli wars</h3>
                    In 1947, the UN adopted a partition plan for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the Jewish Agency for Israel, headed by David Ben-Gurion, declared the establishment of the State of Israel according to the proposed UN plan. The Arab Higher Committee did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with Transjordan, Egypt, and the other members of the Arab League of the time, commenced military action resulting in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were designated to be part of the Arab state under the UN plan. Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip, and Transjordan occupied and then annexed the West Bank. Egypt initially supported the creation of an All-Palestine Government but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form Jordan. The annexation was ratified in 1950 but was rejected by the international community. <br>
                    In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The Palestinian National Charter of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. The Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, ended with Israel occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, besides other territories.[45][better source needed] Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but later relocated to Lebanon in 1971. <br>
                    The October 1974 Arab League summit designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" and reaffirmed "their right to establish an independent state of urgency."[47] In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly granting them observer status as a "non-state entity" at the UN.[48][49] Through the Camp David Accords of 1979, Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan ceded its claims to the West Bank—with the exception of guardianship over Haram al-Sharif—to the PLO. <br>
                    After Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish Israeli settlements there. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the Israeli Civil Administration of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories and by local municipal councils present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988. <br>
                    <h3>Uprising, declaration and peace treaty</h3>
                    The first Intifada broke out in 1987, characterized by widespread protests, strikes, and acts of civil disobedience by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank against Israeli occupation.[18] In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the "State of Palestine".[18] In the month following, it was quickly recognized by many states, including Egypt and Jordan.[18] In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the "Palestinian territory", without explicitly specifying further.[18][51] After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknowledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation "Palestine" instead of "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the UN.[18][51] In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine's government.[52] Violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces intensified throughout 1989, resulting in a significant loss of life and escalating tensions in the occupied territories.[51] 1990 witnessed the imposition of strict measures by the Israeli government, including curfews and closures, in an attempt to suppress the Intifada and maintain control over the occupied territories. <br>
                    The 1990–1991 Gulf War brought increased attention to conflict, leading to heightened diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution.[53][54]

                    Saddam Hussein was a supporter of Palestinian cause and won support from Arafat during the war.[53] Following the invasion of Kuwait, Saddam surprised the international community by presenting a peace offer to Israel and withdrawing Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in exchange of withdrawal from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights.[53][54] Though the peace offer was rejected, Saddam then ordered firing of scud missiles into Israeli territory.[53] This movement was supported by Palestinians.[53] The war also led expulsion of Palestinians from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as their government supported Iraq. <br>
                    In 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and a potential path to peace.[55] Yasser Arafat was elected as president of the newly formed Palestinian Authority in 1994, marking a significant step towards self-governance. <br>

                    Israel acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as "representing the Palestinian people", in return for the PLO recognizing Israel's right to exist in peace, acceptance of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and its rejection of "violence and terrorism".[55] As a result, in 1994 the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA) territorial administration, that exercises some governmental functions[d] in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.[64][65] As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA.[64][65] It was given civilian control in Area B and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in Area C. <br>
                    The peace process gained opposition from both Palestinians and Israelis. Islamist militant organizations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposed the attack and responded by conducting attacks on civilians across Israel.
                    In 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli extremist shot 29 people to death in Hebron, known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. These events led an increase in Palestinian opposition to the peace process. Tragically, in 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir — an extremist, causing political instability in the region. <br>
                    The first-ever Palestinian general elections took place in 1996, resulting in Arafat's re-election as president and the formation of a Palestinian Legislative Council. Initiating the implementation of the Oslo Accords, Israel began redeploying its forces from select Palestinian cities in the West Bank in 1997.[66] Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority continued, albeit with slow progress and contentious debates on Jerusalem, settlements, and refugees in 1998.[66] In 1997, Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian government signed the Hebron Protocol, which outlined the redeployment of Israeli forces from parts of Hebron in the West Bank, granting the government greater control over the city.[66] Israel and the Palestinian government signed the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, aiming to advance the implementation of the Oslo Accords.[66] The agreement included provisions for Israeli withdrawals and security cooperation. <br>
                    The period of Oslo Years, brought a great prosperity to the government-controlled areas, despite some economic issues. The Palestinian Authority built country's second airport in Gaza, after the Jerusalem International Airport. Inaugural ceremony of the airport was attended by Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela. In 1999, Ehud Barak assumed the position of Israeli Prime Minister, renewing efforts to reach a final status agreement with the Palestinians. The Camp David Summit in 2000 aimed to resolve the remaining issues but concluded without a comprehensive agreement, serving as a milestone in the peace process. <br>

                    A peace summit between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak was mediated by Bill Clinton in 2000.[68][69] It was supposed to be the final agreement ending conflict officially forever. However the agreement failed to address the Palestinian refugee issues, status of Jerusalem and Israeli security concerns.[68][69] Both sides blamed each other of the summit failures.[68][69] This became of the main triggers for the uprising that would happen next.[68][69] In September 2000, then opposition leader from the Likud Party – Ariel Sharon made a proactive visit to the Temple Mount and delivered a controversial speech, which angered Palestinian Jerusalemite.[68][69] The tensions escalated into riots.[68][69] Bloody clashes took place around Jerusalem. Escalating violence resulted closure of Jerusalem Airport, which haven't operated till date.[68] More and more riots between Jews and Arabs took place in October 2000 in Israel. <br>
                    In the same month, two Israeli soldiers were lynched and killed in Ramallah.[68] Between November and December clashes between Palestinians and Israelis increased further.[68] In 2001 Taba summit was held between Israel and Palestine.[68] But the summit failed to implement and Ariel Sharon became prime minister in the 2001 elections.[68] By 2001, attacks from Palestinian militant groups towards Israel increased.[68][69] Gaza Airport was destroyed in an airstrike by Israeli army in 2001, claiming itself in retaliation to previous attacks by Hamas.[68][69] In January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos captured the Karine A, a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel.[68] UNSC Resolution 1397 was passed, which reaffirmed a Two-state solution and laid the groundwork for a Road map for peace.[68] An another attack by Hamas left 30 people killed in Netanya.[68] A peace summit was organized by the Arab League in Beirut, which was endorsed by Arafat and virtually ignored by Israel. <br>

                    In 2002, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield after the Passover massacre.[69] Heavy fighting between IDF and Palestinian fighters took place in Jenin.[69][67][70] The Church of the Nativity was besieged by the IDF for one week until successful negotiations took place, which resulted withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the church.[69] Between 2003 and 2004, people from Qawasameh tribe in Hebron were either killed or blew themselves in suicide bombing.[69][66] Ariel Sharon ordered construction of barriers across Palestinian controlled areas and Israeli settlements in the West Bank to prevent future attacks.[69] Saddam Hussein provided financial support to Palestinian militants from Iraq during the intifada period, from 2000 until his overthrew in 2003.[69] A peace proposal was made in 2003,which was supported by Arafat and rejected by Sharon.[69] In 2004 Hamas leader and its co-founder Ahmed Yassin was assassinated by the Israeli army in Gaza.[69][66] Yasser Arafat was confined to his headquarters in Ramallah.[69] On 11 November, Yasser Arafat died in Paris. <br>
                    On first week of 2005, Mahmoud Abbas was elected as the president of the State of Palestine.[69] In 2005, Israel completely withdrew from the Gaza Strip by destroying its settlements over there.[69] By 2005, the situation began de-escalating.[69] In 2006, Hamas won in Palestinian legislative elections.[71] This led a political standoff with Fatah.[71] Armed clashes took place across both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.[71] The clashes turned into a civil war, which ended in a bloody clashes on the Gaza Strip.[71] As a result Hamas gained control allover the territory of Gaza.[71] Hundreds of people were killed in the civil war, including militants and civilians.[71] Since then Hamas gained more independence in its military practices.[71] Since 2007, Israel is leading a partial blockade on Gaza.[71] Another peace summit was organized by the Arab League in 2007, with same offer which was presented in 2002 summit.[71] However the peace process could not progressed.[71][72][73] The PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and territorial waters. <br>
                    <h3>Continued conflict</h3>
                    The division between the West Bank and Gaza complicated efforts to achieve Palestinian unity and negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel. Multiple rounds of reconciliation talks were held, but no lasting agreement was reached. The division also hindered the establishment of a unified Palestinian state and led to different governance structures and policies in the two territories. <br>
                    Throughout this period, there were sporadic outbreaks of violence and tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. Since 2001, Incidents of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli territory and Israeli military operations in response often resulted in casualties and further strained the situation.[75] Following the inter-Palestinian conflict in 2006, Hamas took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and Fatah took control of the West Bank. From 2007, the Gaza Strip was governed by Hamas, and the West Bank by the Fatah party led Palestinian Authority. <br>
                    International efforts to revive the peace process continued. The United States, under the leadership of different administrations, made various attempts to broker negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. <br>
                    However, significant obstacles such as settlement expansion, the status of Jerusalem, borders, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees, remained unresolved.[78][79][80][81] In recent years, diplomatic initiatives have emerged, including the normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab states, known as the Abraham Accords.[82] These agreements, while not directly addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have reshaped regional dynamics and raised questions about the future of Palestinian aspirations for statehood.[83][84] The status quo remains challenging for Palestinians, with ongoing issues of occupation, settlement expansion, restricted movement, and economic hardships.[85] Efforts to find a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continue, but the path towards a comprehensive peace agreement and the establishment of a viable, independent Palestinian state remains uncertain.

                    The areas claimed by the State of Palestine lie in the Southern Levant. The Gaza Strip borders the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east. The West Bank is bordered by Jordan to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west. Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by Israel. These areas would constitute the world's 163rd largest country by land area. <br>
                    The West Bank is located on the western side of the Jordan River and is characterized by a diverse landscape. It consists of fertile valleys, such as the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan River Valley, as well as mountainous areas, including the Samarian and Judean mountain ranges.[88] East Jerusalem, a part of the West Bank, is a significant component of the Palestinian territories. It is located on a plateau in the central highlands and is surrounded by valleys. The Old City of Jerusalem, with its historical and religious sites, is centrally located within East Jerusalem. The Gaza Strip is a small coastal enclave located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. <br>
                    Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by the ongoing dispute. <br>
                    The Samarian Hills and Judean Hills are mountain ranges in the West Bank, with Mount Gerizim and Mount Hebron as their highest peaks.[90] The Mount of Olives (Jabal Zaytun) is a significant hill east of Jerusalem, known for its religious sites.[91] Mount Carmel extends into the northern West Bank and is renowned for its natural beauty.[92] Three terrestrial ecoregions are found in the area: Eastern Mediterranean conifer–sclerophyllous–broadleaf forests, Arabian Desert, and Mesopotamian shrub desert.[93] Palestine features significant lakes and rivers that play a vital role in its geography and ecosystems.[94] The Jordan River flows southward, forming part of Palestine's eastern border and passing through the Sea of Galilee before reaching the Dead Sea.[95] These waterways provide essential resources for agriculture, recreation, and support various ecosystems. 
                    <h3>Climate</h3>
                    Temperatures in Palestine vary widely. The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate. Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers.[citation needed] Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being 33 °C (91 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 7 °C (45 °F). Rain is scarce and generally falls between November and March, with annual precipitation rates approximately at 4.57 inches (116 mm).
                    <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                    Palestine does not have officially recognized national parks or protected areas. However, there are areas within the West Bank that are considered to have ecological and cultural significance and are being managed with conservation efforts. These areas are often referred to as nature reserves or protected zones. Located near Jericho in the West Bank, Wadi Qelt is a desert valley with unique flora and fauna. <br>
                    The reserve is known for its rugged landscapes, natural springs, and historical sites such as the St. George Monastery.[97] Efforts have been made to protect the biodiversity and natural beauty of the area.[98] The Judaean Desert is popular for "Judaean Camels". Qalqilya Zoo in Qalqilya Governorate, is the only zoo currently active in the country. Gaza Zoo was closed due to poor conditions. Israeli government have built various national parks in the Area C, which is also considered illegal under international law.

                    Palestine operates a semi-presidential system of government.[99] The country consists of the institutions that are associated with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which includes President of the State of Palestine[100][c] – appointed by the Palestinian Central Council,[103] Palestinian National Council – the legislature that established the State of Palestine[5] and Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization – performs the functions of a government in exile,[101][102][104][105] maintaining an extensive foreign-relations network. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is combination of several political parties. <br>
                    These should be distinguished from the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) and PNA Cabinet, all of which are instead associated with the Palestinian National Authority. The State of Palestine's founding document is the Palestinian Declaration of Independence,[5] and it should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO Palestinian National Covenant and PNA Palestine Basic Law. <br>
                    The Palestinian government is divided into two geographic entities — the Palestinian Authority governed by Fatah and have control over the territory of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which is under control of the militant group Hamas.[106][107] Fatah is a secular party, which was founded by Yasser Arafat and relatively enjoys good relations with the western powers. On other hand, Hamas is a militant group, based on Palestinian nationalist and Islamic ideology, inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood.[108][109] Hamas has tense relations with the United States, but receives support from Iran. Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is another popular secular party, which was founded by George Habash. Mahmoud Abbas is the president of the country since 2005.[110] Mohammad Shtayyeh was the prime minister of Palestine, who resigned in 2024.[111] In 2024, Mohammad Mustafa was appointed as the new prime minister of the country, after resigning of Shtayyeh.[112] While Yahya Sinwar is leader of Hamas government in the Gaza Strip.[113] According to Freedom House, the PNA governs Palestine in an authoritarian manner, including by repressing activists and journalists critical of the government.[114] <br>
                    Jerusalem including Haram ash-Sharif, is claimed as capital by Palestine, which has been under occupation by Israel.[115] Currently the temporary administration center is in Ramallah, which is 10 km from Jerusalem.[116] Muqata hosts state ministries and representative office.[117] The former building Gaza was destroyed in 2009 war.[118] In 2000, a government building was built in Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis, to house office of Yasser Arafat and Palestinian parliament.[119] Since second intifada, condition of the town made this site unsuitable to operate as a capital, either temporarily or permanently.[120] Nevertheless, the Palestinian entity have maintained their presence in the city. As few parts of the city is also under Palestinian control and many some countries have their consulates in Jerusalem. <br>
                    <h3>Law and security</h3>
                    The State of Palestine has a number of security forces, including a Civil Police Force, National Security Forces and Intelligence Services, with the function of maintaining security and protecting Palestinian citizens and the Palestinian State. All of these forces are part of Palestinian Security Services. The PSF is primarily responsible for maintaining internal security, law enforcement, and counterterrorism operations in areas under Palestinian Authority control. <br>
                    The Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) is the standing army of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).[122] It was established during the early years of the Palestinian national movement but has largely been inactive since the Oslo Accords.[123] The PLA's role was intended to be a conventional military force but has shifted to a more symbolic and political role.
                    <h3>Military</h3>
                    The Palestinian Security Services consists of the armed forces and intelligence agencies, which were established during the Oslo Accords. Their function is to maintain internal security and enforce law in the PA-controlled areas. It dosen't operate as an independent armed force of a country. Before the Oslo Accords, the PLO led armed rebellion against Israel, which included coalition of militant groups and included its own military branch – the Palestine Liberation Army.[125] However since the 1993–1995 agreements, it has been inactive and operates only in Syria. Palestinian fedayeen are the Palestinian militants and guerilla army. They are considered as "freedom fighter" by Palestinians and "terrorists" by Israelis.[126] Hamas considers itself as an independent force, which is more powerful and influential than PSF, along with other militant organizations such as Islamic Jihad (Al-Quds Bridage).[127] It is a guerilla army, which is supported by Iran, Qatar and Turkey.[128] According to the CIA World Factbook, the Qassam Brigades have 20,000 to 25,000 members, although this number is disputed.[129] Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to develop its military wing. <br>
                    Iran and Hezbollah have smuggled weapons to Hamas overland through Sinai via Sudan and Libya, as well as by sea.[130] Intensive military training and accumulated weapons have allowed Hamas to gradually organize regional units as large as brigades containing 2,500-3,500 fighters each.[130] Joint exercises since 2020 (such as this one) conducted with other Gazan armed factions like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (IJ) have habituated units to operating in a coordinated fashion, supported Hamas command and control, and facilitated cooperation between Hamas and smaller factions.[130] Such efforts began in earnest once Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip in 2007.[130] Iran has since supplied materiel and know-how for Hamas to build a sizable rocket arsenal, with more than 10,000 rockets and mortar shells fired in the current conflict.[130] With Iran’s help, Hamas has developed a robust domestic rocket-making industry that uses pipes, electrical wiring, and other everyday materials for improvised production.
