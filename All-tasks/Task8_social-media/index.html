                    Early computing
                    The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.


                    IMP log for the first message sent over the Internet, using ARPANET
                    ARPANET, which came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or "netiquette") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[14] ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s.[15] Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, was the first open social media app, established in 1980.


                    A bulletin board system menu, featuring opinion polls and a "Who's been on today?" query
                    A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system (BBS), known as Community Memory, appeared by 1973. Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which launched on February 16, 1978. Before long, most major US cities had more than one BBS, running on TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, IBM PC, Commodore 64, Sinclair, and similar personal computers. CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.[16] Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

                    In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet, creating the World Wide Web. This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs, list servers, and email services. Message forums migrated to the web, and evolved into Internet forums, supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously.

                    These early text-based systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century, aided by digital cameras and camera phones.[17]

                    Social media platforms

                    SixDegrees, launched in 1997, is often regarded as the first social media site.
                    The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 2.0.[6]

                    Social media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities, Classmates.com, and SixDegrees.com.[18] While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it "the very first social networking site".[18][19] The platform's name was inspired by the "six degrees of separation" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[20]

                    In the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.[21]

                    Research from 2015 reported that globally, users spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[22] likely fueled by the availability of smartphones.[23] As of 2023 as many as 4.76 billion people used social media[24] some 59% of the global population.

                    Definition
                    A 2015 review identified four features unique to social media services:[2]

                    Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.[2][3]
                    User-generated content[2][3]
                    User-created self profiles[2][5]
                    Social networks formed by connections between profiles,[2][5] such as followers, groups, and lists.
                    In 2019, Merriam-Webster defined social media as "forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos)."[25]

                    Services
                    Social media encompasses an expanding suite of services:[26]

                    Blogs (ex. HuffPost, Boing Boing)
                    Business networks (ex. LinkedIn, XING)
                    Collaborative projects (Mozilla, GitHub)
                    Enterprise social networks (Yammer, Socialcast, Slack)
                    Forums (Gaia Online, IGN)
                    Microblogs (Twitter, Tumblr, Weibo)
                    Photo sharing (Pinterest, Flickr, Photobucket)
                    Products/services review (Amazon, Upwork)
                    Social bookmarking (Delicious, Pinterest)
                    Social gaming including MMORPG (Fortnite, World of Warcraft)
                    Social network (Facebook, Instagram, Baidu Tieba, VK, QZone, ShareChat, WeChat, LINE)
                    Video sharing (YouTube, Vimeo)
                    Virtual worlds (Second Life, Twinity)
                    Some services offer more than one type of service.[5]

                    Mobile social media
                    Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as phones and tablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location.

                    According to Andreas Kaplan, mobile social media activities fall among four types:[27]

                    Space-timers (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time (posting about a traffic jam)
                    Space-locators (only location sensitive): Posts/messages with relevance for a specific location, read later by others (e.g. a restaurant review)
                    Quick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy (e.g. posting status updates)
                    Slow-timers (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a video)
