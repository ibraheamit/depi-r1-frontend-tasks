                        <h2>Quad Monkey</h2>
                        <p>Hello,
                            This is Jana and I’m here with another of our famous Monkey stories. As you’ll hear, this is a particularly speedy story.
                            
                            Quad Monkey
                            
                            The Jungle is by and large a peaceful place. The animals enjoy the music of the cicadas and the birds, and occasionally there is a trumpet or a distant roar. At the beginning of our tale, such trumpeting was scarce, as the elephants had set off on their annual migration beyond the great mountain, leaving a serene stillness in their wake.
                            
                            Until one day, this peace was shattered by a harsh buzzing sound.
                            
                            [Sound of a chainsaw]
                            
                            The animals instinctively knew that the noise was something to do with the humans, because most strange things in this world are. The monkey, who is less afraid of the humans than the other animals, went to investigate. From the safety of a high-up branch, he watched a man slicing through bushes with an electric saw, while others hacked at the undergrowth with sharp, curved scythes. Leaves fluttered to the ground and branches snapped underfoot as the men worked. The monkey soon realised that these humans were clearing the jungle tracks, worn down by elephant feet. They were making them broader and more open, even felling trees to brighten the path with sunlight.
                            
                            After he returned home, the other animals gathered around his tree to listen to what he had found out. He told them what he had seen - and then the others spoke in turn. They all had their theories. The bear was the first to give his view, all the while having a jolly good scratch against a tree.
                            
                            “I’m very happy to hear this news. It’s about time we had some decent roads through our jungle. The state of those jungle tracks is atrocious!” The bear’s deep voice rumbled through the clearing.
                            
                            The majority of the animals did not share the bear’s enthusiasm. The jackal, pacing nervously, raised his snout and warned, “Mark my words, the humans will ride on the backs of elephants along those tracks.”
                            
                            “Meaw.. And they will shoot their guns at the animals with the most valuable coats,” added the tigress, flicking her tail.
                            
                            “Worse still, they will drive noisy machines along the new roads and run us over!” feared the hedgehog, his quills trembling.
                            
                            Then, the guinea fowl ran around in circles crying, “Oh deary me. Fly away! Fly away, as quick as you can. We are all doomed!” Her feathers fluffed out in panic.
                            
                            Some of the birds took flight, but they soon returned when they remembered they had abandoned their eggs and chicks in their nests. Wings flapped and rustled as they settled back onto their branches.
                            
                            The monkey called out, “Calm down, people! Calm down! It’ain’t the end of the world yet. I’ll keep an eye on the humans and keep you posted!”
                            
                            Over the next few weeks, he saw how the humans continued to clear the elephant tracks, making a broad path that cut through the jungle in a big circle that came right back to where it started. The sound of chopping and sawing became a constant background noise.
                            
                            The bear thought the circular path was a brilliant idea: “It shows how clever the humans are! They never get lost because when they go on a journey they always end up where they started!” He chuckled, his belly shaking.
                            
                            The monkey, however, was suspicious: “I’m not sure why they’re going round in circles, but I will find out,” he promised, scratching his head thoughtfully.
                            
                            And it wasn’t long before a different sort of buzzing sound woke the bear and the monkey one morning. The bear bounded and the monkey swung over to the sound, and sure enough, they saw something very unexpected.
                            
                            The bear squinted and asked, “What kind of animals are those?”
                            
                            “Those aren’t animals, those are humans on wheels,” declared the monkey, hanging upside down from a branch, his tail curling round for balance.
                            
                            “You sure? They don’t look much like humans to me,” said the bear, with a puzzled look. “They're all sorts of bright colours with zig-zaggy patterns and their heads are twice as big as human heads and I can’t see their eyes.”
                            
                            “That’s because they are wearing silly clothes and funny hats,” said the monkey, swinging back upright and pointing with one hand. “They are dressed up like that to have fun!”
                            
                            The bear shook his head, trying to understand. “Their idea of fun is very noisy,” he complained, putting his fingers in his ears as the roar of engines grew louder, vibrating through the ground and shaking the leaves.
                            
                            And he was right. The humans on wheels were making a terrific amount of noise as they zoomed around the tracks, their strange vehicles kicking up dust and leaves.
                            
                            In fact, the humans were riding quad bikes with four big wheels. The adults rode big bikes, and the kids rode smaller ones. Some of the humans were standing up as they rode, and some were sitting, but they were all gripping big handlebars for steering, and having a lot of fun.
                            
                            The monkey and the bear watched, wide-eyed. One rider took a sharp turn, the quad bike skidding and then righting itself.
                            
                            “Maybe those round hats are to cover their heads in case it rains,” suggested the monkey.
                            
                            The riders were, of course, wearing protective gear including racing suits and helmets. But of course animals don’t have protective clothing - so they didn’t understand why they were dressed like that.
                            
                            One rider flew over a bump, almost coming off his bike. The vehicle soared high in the air before landing smoothly. Even the monkey was impressed by their acrobatics.
                            
                            “Ooh ooh that looks like a lot of fun,” he said, enviously.
                            
                            Then a rider went tipping over, and went head first into the foliage before standing up and brushing himself off.
                            
                            “That looks like ‘ouch!’” exclaimed the bear.
                            
                            The quad biking continued for the coming days. The engines whining and roaring on the jungle circuit became a constant presence echoing through the trees. Some of the braver animals, such as the tigress, came over to get a glimpse of the noisy creatures on wheels, cautiously peeking as the riders zoomed past, their colourful racing suits and helmets creating a blur of motion.
                            
                            But most of the animals did not share her curiosity. The noise was too much for them to bear, and they stayed far away from the tracks. The constant roar and rumble were not just annoying but quite frightening, sending shivers down their spines and making their hearts race.
                            
                            Soon, quite a few animals started to talk about moving home - because who wants to live with noisy neighbours like those quad bikers!
                            
                            But the monkey was fascinated by the thrills and spills of the quad racing, and sat on a branch watching, becoming more and more green with envy.
                            Often he said to the bear something like,
                            
                            “Awwww! Humans have all the fun! Wish I could have a go, don’t you, bear?”
                            
                            “I’m not sure about that,” said the Bear, “do you think they’ve got those zig-zaggy pants in my size?”
                            
                            The idea of riding one of the strange bikes grew and grew in the monkey's mind, until he was thinking about nothing else all day - not even bananas - and he dreamt about nothing else all night. In fact, he would wake up in the morning saying, “Broom Broom…Broom,” and he would swing through the trees saying,
                            “EEEEEEEENAWWWWWWWWWW!” so that all the other animals thought the bike sounds had driven him out of his monkey mind.
                            
                            Eventually, he said to himself, “I’ve just got to try one of those bikes.”
                            
                            One evening, when the humans had finished buzzing around the track for the day, he climbed into the compound where all the vehicles were kept.
                            
                            Ever so carefully, he approached one of the smaller bikes, suitable for his size. He climbed onto the seat, his hands gripping the handlebars. He had watched the humans closely, so he had a rough idea of what to do. He pushed a button, and the bike roared to life, making him jump.
                            
                            “Whoa!” he exclaimed, his tail twitching with a mix of fear and exhilaration.
                            
                            He twisted the accelerator tentatively, and the bike jerked forward, almost throwing him off. He held on tightly, his eyes wide. “This is terrific!” he called out.
                            
                            But the better he got at riding the bike, the more frustrated he became, because all he could do was ride around the compound. What he really wanted was to whizz around the jungle tracks, like the humans did. He drove up to the gate, jumped off the bike, and shook it. The gate rattled but remained firmly closed.
                            
                            “If only I could get a big strong animal to help me,” he thought. “Mmm, like a tigress, no, I don’t think a tigress could bite through the gate, or…er - a bear - but even the bear’s head is not hard enough to charge through the gate - I know! I need an elephant to help me! An elephant could knock down the gate, easy-peasy! Ahhhh! But the elephants are not here right now. They’re on the other side of the Great Mountain.”
                            
                            The monkey sighed, remembering the majestic elephants. Every year, the elephants migrated to the lush valleys beyond the Great Mountain in search of the abundant food and water that the rainy season brought. They travelled to these fertile lands to feast on fresh grass, leaves, and fruit, and to bathe in the plentiful rivers and lakes.
                            
                            However, he also knew that the elephants always returned to this part of the jungle once the dry season began. They would come back to the jungle to find shade under the dense canopy and drink from the deep, ancient water holes that never dried up.
                            
                            And as it happened, he did not have to wait too long before waking up one day to a distant, deep rumbling sound - not a buzzy whine like a quad bike, but a deeper Boom! Boom! As the sound came closer, the ground trembled slightly - and the leaves in the monkey’s tree rustled.
                            
                            The monkey’s ears perked up, and he scrambled to the top of the tallest tree to get a better look. From his vantage point, he saw a line of elephants travelling along the ancient jungle path.
                            
                            “Whoopie!” he called out.
                            
                            Sure enough, as the minutes passed, the mighty silhouettes of the elephants began to appear through the trees. Their massive forms moved gracefully, and their trunks swung rhythmically as they marched. The leader of the herd let out a loud trumpet, announcing their return to their home in the jungle.
                            
                            Then from his tree, the Monkey called out, “Oh Mighty King of the Elephants, welcome back to the Jungle. I am sorry to be the bearer of terrible news - but as you will shortly discover, the humans have built a compound on your sacred ground, the place where your ancestors’ tusks are buried, where the Great Elephant Spirit watches over the jungle.”
                            
                            “Do you swear this is not one of your tricks, monkey?” demanded the king of the Jungle.
                            
                            “I swear by the Great Banana Tree! You will soon see for yourself that this monkey does not lie!”
                            
                            The King of the Elephants' eyes widened with anger. “Our ancestors' resting place?”
                            
                            “Yes!” the monkey exclaimed, gesturing dramatically. “They even built a fence to keep you out, as if you were mere trespassers in your own home!”
                            
                            The elephants began to trumpet angrily, their eyes narrowing with fury. The King of the Elephants raised his trunk and let out a powerful, call. “This is an outrage! We must reclaim our sacred ground and restore honour to our ancestors!”
                            
                            With a loud trumpet blast, the elephants charged towards the compound. The ground shook with their powerful steps, and the jungle echoed with their determined cries.
                            
                            That evening, the monkey and the bear returned to retrieve the bikes.
                            
                            “Monkey,” asked the bear, “Can you really ride one of those things?”
                            
                            “Sure,” said the monkey, “I’ll be your driving instructor if you like.”
                            
                            He jumped on the smaller bike and showed the bear how to rev up the engine and shoot off. The monkey zoomed around effortlessly, demonstrating with impressive flair. The bear, trying to copy him, revved up his bike but shot straight into a termite hill and tumbled off.
                            
                            “Ha! Ha!” cried out the monkey. “Maybe you should wear a crash helmet!”
                            
                            Because he had figured out what the strange hats the humans wore were for. He was a clever monkey, you see.
                            
                            After they both donned helmets—and the monkey found a pair of zig-zaggy racing pants—they headed off around the jungle tracks. Despite the annoying roaring and buzzing of the bikes, the animals, birds, and insects all watched in amazement at their fellow animals on wheels.
                            
                            The bear, still a bit wobbly, managed to stay upright and even started to enjoy himself. The monkey zoomed around, performing little tricks and making the other animals laugh. The jungle, once disturbed by human activity, was now filled with the joyous sounds of their own kind having fun.
                            
                            And so, the monkey and the bear raced around the tracks, the jungle echoing with their laughter and the astonished chatter of the other animals.
                            
                            And as for the humans, when they saw the devastation of their racing enterprise, they packed up what remained of their equipment and moved their racing track to the desert where the noise and dust wouldn't disturb the delicate balance of nature. As the old jungle saying goes, "Where the elephants tread, wisdom and peace are sure to follow." And so, with the might and wisdom of the elephants, tranquillity was restored to the jungle once more.</p>

                        <p>Hello,

                            This is Jana, and I’m here with two of our popular monkey stories. If you have heard them before, you will know that they are small, cheeky, and sweet - just like monkeys! And just in case you are waiting for the Ramayana, we’ll be back with our epic serial soon. The first of our stories is called, The Cat who wanted to be a monkey
                            
                            [Bring up Music]
                            
                            Once upon a time, Mother Bushcat, Father Bushcat, and Baby Bushcat were watching the monkey playing. They saw how he drank flower nectar, ate fruit, picked flees from his friends fur, and swung through the trees shrieking and chattering. Indeed, he was a very noisy monkey, and best known for his naughty tricks.
                            “It’s alright for some,” said Mother Bushcat, after picking up Baby Bushcat for the fifteenth time that day and putting him back in their den.
                            “Yes, monkeys lead a very easy life,” said Father Bushcat as he stretched and yawned.
                            And then Baby Bushcat piped up, “Mummy, can I be a monkey someday when I grow up?”
                            Mother Buschat laughed and said: “Oh how you wish you were a monkey! But no dear, you were born a bushcat and you will always be a bushcat. That’s the law of the jungle.
                            “Ooooooh!! That’s not fairrrrrrrr!!!!” protested Baby Bushcat, “I’m sure the monkeys would really like me to join them if I asked them nicely.”
                            “Well you can try dear, and see what happens” said Mother Bushcat, who was sure that her baby would soon forget about his idea to become a monkey.
                            But Baby Bushcat did not forget his ambition to become a monkey, and as soon as he was old enough to prowl out and about on his own, under strict instructions not to stray too far, and to come back before dark, he set out to find the place where the monkeys were playing. Sure enough, he soon found a monkey sitting with his back to a banana tree.
                            “Meehow, Mr Monkey, I’m Baby Bushcat, pleased to meet you,”
                            “Likewise, Baby Bushcat,” said the Monkey as he peeled a banana.
                            “I’ve seen you play, and I’d like to be a monkey too, if I can please,” said Baby Bushcat.
                            “Well now, it’s no easy matter for a Baby Bushcat to grow up into a monkey,” said the Monkey.
                            “Oh, please let me be a monkey, please, I really really want to be a monkey, and I’ll never forget you if you help me, and I’ll always pick your flees whenever you ask me.”
                            “Alright then,” said the Monkey, “We monkeys like enthusiasm. If you really want to be a monkey first you must learn to scratch my back. I’ve got an itch just in the middle, but mind you are not too sharp with your claws.”
                            Baby Bushcat scratched the Monkey’s back and the monkey said, “Ahh, that’s just right.
                            “Great, can I be a monkey now?’
                            “Hold on, hold on, not just yet. Next you must learn to harvest bananas. Climb up into that tree and get me a few.”
                            Right away, the cat sprang up into the tree and cut down six bananas with his claw, and then he jumped down onto the forest floor and said.
                            “I’ve done it! I’ve cut down some bananas. Now can I be a monkey? Please! Please!”
                            “Hold on, hold on, not just yet. We’ve got to sort out that tail of yours first.”
                            “What’s wrong with my tail? I’ve got a good tail, haven’t I?”
                            “Yes, it’s ok tail for a baby bushcat, but it isn’t long enough for a monkey.”
                            “So what can I do?”
                            “Hold on a minute, I’ll help you.” replied the monkey, who got up and began to pull Baby Bushcat’s tail.
                            “Oooh, that hurts,” said Baby Bushcat, “is it long enough yet?”
                            “Hmm, not yet, but I’ll tell you what, I’ll just tie your tail to this branch and that will do the trick.”
                            “Tie my tail to a branch? I don’t want you to tie my tail to a branch. Please don’t do it.
                            “Hold on a minute. I thought you said you wanted me to help you to become a monkey?”
                            “I did.”
                            “Well then. Just let me tie your tail to this branch, and before too long. You’ll be one.”
                            “Alright then. I suppose if you have to.”
                            And so the Baby Bushcat let the monkey tie his tail to a branch of the banana tree. The monkey used some vines to tie him by a strong monkey-knot and then stood back to admire Baby Bushcat who was now swinging upside down from the branch, almost like monkeys do.
                            “Now can I be a monkey please?” Baby Bushcat asked, as he swung there by his tail.
                            “Ha Ha! I Monkey tricked you!,” called out the monkey as he flew off through the trees laughing to himself at the wonderful trick he had played on the Baby Bushcat who was left meowing and crying for his mummy. To tell you the truth, it was a very mean trick of the monkey to play on the Baby Bushcat.
                            Now Baby Bushcat’s tail was really starting to hurt and he started to sob.
                            “I want my mummy! I don’t want to be a monkey anymore.”
                            . Eventually Mother Bushcat came out to find him and she bit through the vines and let him down.
                            “Who tied your tail to that branch?” she asked.
                            And Baby Bushcat sobbed, “The monkey”
                            “And do you still want to become a monkey?”
                            “No I don’t because monkeys play mean tricks.”
                            “Well you’ve learned a good lesson today,” said Mother Bushcat. And from that day on Baby Bushcat wanted to grow up to be a Bushcat just like Father Bushcat, which he did, and when he had his own babies, he told them to watch the monkeys and laugh at them, but never to try and be one.
                            
                            And that was the story of the Cat that wanted to be a Monkey. In a moment, I’m going to tell you another Monkey story - this one’s called the Monkey who wanted to Fly - but first, let’s hear from this week’s sponsor, Wondery!
                            
                            And now, on with our next story, which is called, The Monkey Who Wanted to Fly!
                            
                            Now as you know, the Monkey was always playing tricks on the other animals. I’ve already told you about the time that he tied Baby Bushcat to a tree by his tail, and he was always catching the other animals by surprise, making them jump with a sudden shriek, or sneaking up when they were asleep and pulling their noses. He thought that his tricks were very, very funny, but the other animals found him very, very annoying. And the biggest and proudest beasts, like the Bear, the Tiger, and the eagle were most annoyed with him of all.
                            “Growl!” said the Bear, “I wish I could bear-punch him, but he’s too fast, and he always dodges.”
                            “Grrrrr!” said the Tiger, “I wished I could bite his cheeky head off, but he won’t hang around long enough for me to eat him!”
                            And then the eagle, who was the king of the birds, said: “SQUARK! I’d like to pick him up by the scruff of his neck, fly high into the sky, and drop him into the ocean.”
                            “MMM. What a delightful idea!,” purred the Tiger.
                            “I like the way you think,” said the Bear. “Why don’t you do it? It will be a service to animal-kind.”
                            “I would,” said the eagle, “But he hides in the trees where the branches are too thick for me to swoop down and catch him.”
                            And the Bear, the Tiger, and the Eagle grumbled among themselves that nobody would ever catch that monkey and he would carry on playing annoying tricks until the end of time!
                            Now a little mouse happened to be listening to the conversation of the three Big Beasts, and he squeezed up:
                            “Excuse me sirs, if you don’t mind me suggesting, but if you want to catch a trickster, you have to play a trick.”
                            “That’s right. He’s got a point,” said the Bear.
                            “But what trick can we play?” asked the Tiger.
                            “Remember, he knows all the tricks, because he’s played them already,” said the eagle.
                            “I know! I have an idea!” said the mouse,” and he told them his plan, which the three big beasts thought was a super-smart idea, and ordered the other animals and birds to put it into action.
                            The eagle announced that for one day only, he was willing to take any animal who wanted, up into the air for free to experience what it felt like to fly, and he promised not to eat them.
                            Normally, none of the other animals would have agreed to try anything like that, because the idea of flying can be very frightening, unless you are a bird. But the Bear and the Tiger ordered the smaller animals including the Gerbil and the Tortoise, the Bushcat, to queue up and wait for their turn to go flying. As promised, the eagle picked each one of them up, soared into the air, and returned them safely to the ground. The smaller animals reported that flying was a bit sick-making, but very thrilling, and they were so happy to be alive when they returned, that they did a little dance and told everyone else that they should try it too.
                            Now the monkey saw the animals go up in the air and return safely, and eventually he could not resist the chance to experience what it was like to fly. So he stepped forward and said:
                            “Can I have a go?”
                            “That’s a good fellow Monkey!” roared the Tiger. “It will be the thrill of a lifetime! I wish I could have a go up, but. I’m too heavy to fly. Now you’re just the right size, and you’ll love it!”
                            And then the monkey clung for dear life to the eagle’s legs as the bird’s great wings soared across the air warm currents, over the tops of the trees, and out above the waves of the ocean.
                            “Hey, I feel air sick, can we go back now please?” asked the monkey.
                            “Ha! Ha! Tricked you!” called back the eagle, who started to swoop this way and that until the monkey was so dizzy he would not hold on any more, and he fell down into the sea the eagle called out:
                            “Bombs Away!”
                            Now that would have been the end of the monkey. But it so happened that a fisherman caught the monkey in his net and hauled him on board. The monkey was the strangest fish he had ever seen - and he soon shot up to the top of the boat’s mast where he sat above the sail like a look out in his nest until they reached the shoreline where he hopped into the branches of a nearby tree.
                            The eagle returned to the spot where he had left the other animals and declared.
                            “Mission accomplished. I dropped the cargo into the ocean waves. The Monkey has tricked his last!”
                            But no sooner had he spoken than The Monkey called out from a nearby tree.
                            “Ha! Ha! Tricked You!” And the three big beasts jumped into the air with shock.
                            “Thanks for taking me flying.” called out the Monkey. “I didn’t ask to go swimming! But that was fun too! See you soon for another funny trick!”
                            “AAAAAAAH!” growled the tiger at the eagle. “Mission accomplished you said? Total failure more like like,”
                            And the eagle saw how angry the Tiger and the Bear were, and decided to fly back to his nest on top of a craggy mountain.</p>

                        <h2>The Bear’s Birthday Party</h2>
                        <p>Hello this is Jana,

                            And I’m here with one of our mischievous monkey stories. in this story you will hear that he is a real party animal.
                            
                            There were three things in life that the monkey liked above all else and they were:
                            Bananas, music, and tricks. This story combines all three.
                            
                            It was the time of year when the bear was getting ready to celebrate his birthday. He was going to be five years old, which meant that he was almost grown up.
                            
                            He was preparing to spend the whole day on his own, lazing on the bank of the river with a big pile of his favourite foods. But as he stood on his hind legs collecting cherries from a tree, a little mouse asked him:
                            
                            “Hey, Mr Bear, are you having a party this year?”
                            
                            “No,” growled the bear.
                            
                            “Why not? Parties are fun. I had 200 mice come to my birthday bash.”
                            
                            “Good for you,” said the bear. “But I don’t have any friends.”
                            
                            “Oh that’s easy to solve,” said the mouse. “When you are throwing a party, everyone’s your friend, especially if you have plenty of delicious food and great music.”
                            
                            “Yeah?” said the bear. “I could collect fish, nuts and berries for my new friends, but where would I find music?”
                            
                            “Well, you should ask the monkey,” said the mouse. “He played his guitar and sang with his cousins at my birthday bash and everyone raved all night long. He loves music so much that he would play for free, but if you pay him bananas, he’ll play even better.”
                            
                            “I bet he would,” mumbled the bear, who had no intention of asking the monkey to play music at his party, especially if he had to pay him. Why, he didn’t even like that annoying monkey who was always playing tricks that made the bear look foolish.
                            
                            “Naaaa,” said the Bear to the mouse. “I don’t think I’ll have a party this year. I’m not in the mood.”
                            
                            And so he scooped up all the cherries in his arms and waddled off to his cave to enjoy them on his own. But not long after he was back in his cave, his neighbour, the Tigress, dropped by and roared:
                            
                            “Hey Bear, what are you doing for your birthday? Let’s have a party.”
                            
                            “Naaaa,” said the Bear. “I’m not in a party sort of mood.”
                            
                            “Well get yourself into one,” said the Tigress. “Otherwise, the word will get round that you’re an old party-pooper, and you wouldn’t want that, would you?”
                            
                            “Grrrrrr,” growled the Bear. “Why should I have a party if I don’t want to? It’s my birthday, and I can be a pooper if I want to.”
                            
                            “But you do want to have a party, you just don’t know it yet,” the Tigress purred, which the bear thought was a very strange thing to say, because how could she know what the bear really wanted?
                            
                            “Don’t shake y0ur grizzly head,” said the Tigress. “Listen up. Our friend the monkey is a real party animal. If we invite him to play the music, he won’t be able to resist. We’ll have free music and dancing all night.”
                            
                            “But I don’t like music and dancing,” protested the Bear.”And I like the monkey even less. GRRRRR ! Just the thought of him makes my hair bristle.”
                            
                            “You won’t regret it,” said the Tigress, “because as soon as the party is nearly over, I’ll give the secret signal, and we’ll both jump on the monkey, and that will be the end of him, and all our troubles. Won’t that be the best birthday present you’ll get this year?”
                            
                            “You’ve got a point!” said the bear smacking his lips at the thought of finally getting his claws on the monkey. “That would be the best birthday present EVER!”
                            
                            So the bear asked the mouse to ask the monkey to play the music at his party. And the monkey agreed. Then the bear invited all the animals to his moonlit birthday bash in the clearing outside his cave.
                            
                            The monkey, together with his three cousins who were in the band, built a treehouse above the cave from where they rocked the jungle!
                            
                            And of course they didn’t forget to play Happy Birthday for the Bear!
                            
                            All the animals were dancing and having such enormous fun that the bigger animals even forgot to eat the smaller ones - at least for the evening.
                            
                            But just in case anyone stood on them, the smaller animals were dancing up in the tree house where the monkeys were playing. Meanwhile, the big beasts, like the elephant, the bear and the tigress, were stomping down on the ground making the whole jungle throb to the beat.
                            
                            Occasionally arguments broke out, such as when th hippo accused the rhino of stepping on his toes, but the bear smoothed the argument over saying:
                            
                            “Now, now, no quarrelling or else I’ll throw you out of my party and you’ll miss all the fun!”
                            
                            Finally, as the first rosy rays of the dawn appeared in the sky behind the volcano, the monkey announced:
                            
                            “Thank you for being such a lovely audience. For our final number, we’re going to play a slow song, so find your favourite partner and gaze into their eyes!”
                            
                            “Hey Bear, would you like to dance with me,” asked the Tigress. And the bear said sleepily:
                            
                            “All right, if you insist.”
                            
                            And the bear began to lead the Tigress round in a two-step, until the bear said: “Hang on, when are you going to give the secret signal to catch the monkey?”
                            
                            “Very soon,” purred the tigress, who had been having such fun she had almost forgotten about the plan. “But first we have to sneak up close to the monkey so we are within pouncing distance.”
                            
                            Then the two of them danced towards the tree where the monkeys were playing. The tigress jumped onto a lower branch and the bear pulled himself up onto another. Up and up they climbed while the monkey crooned away. Eventually they reached the treehouse. There they pretended to dance together, just like they were deep in love. The smaller animals all started to leave, because they did not want to be trodden on.
                            
                            The Monkey was reaching the final notes of his slow number, when a little voice - it was the Mouse - squeaked “Encore!” and all the little animals who were leaving called out, “Encore! Encore!”
                            
                            Immediately the Monkey and his band launched into a bouncy number with such a great beat that the Tigress and the Bear could not help themselves - they started to jump up and down in time to the music. The treehouse began to shake, but they didn’t notice because they were having such fun - and then the branches began to creek - but they didn’t notice because the music was so loud - and then - just as the Tigress was about to give the secret signal to pounce on the monkey:
                            
                            CRASH! Bang! Wallop!
                            
                            The whole dance floor collapsed and the Tigress and the Bear went flying with it, tumbling head over heels through the branches, snapping them on the way, until eventually they landed on the jungle floor with a great big thud!
                            
                            But of course the monkeys weren’t hurt at all - laughing hysterically, they just swung onto the nearby trees, taking their instruments with them.
                            
                            And the little animals had already left, so they weren’t hurt either.
                            
                            Only the Bear and the Tigress were bruised and very annoyed. But the Bear was most annoyed of all, in fact, he was very very angry, not with the monkey, but with the Tigress. “You ruined my party! You’re the worst Party Pooper of all time!” he roared - and the Tigress, seeing how angry the bear was, hobbled away as fast as her legs could carry her.
                            
                            And that was ‘The Bear’s Birthday Party’ read by me, Jana, for Storynory.com.
